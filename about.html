            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate full-stack developer with a strong focus on delivering seamless user experiences
                through modern web technologies.
            </p>
            <p>I am a dedicated web developer with over 5 years of experience in full-stack development. I specialize in
                creating responsive, user-friendly web applications using technologies like React, Node.js, and
                JavaScript. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, which has equipped me with the foundational
                skills to tackle complex technical challenges.</p>
            <p>
                In addition to technical development, I have a passion for UX/UI design, ensuring that all my projects
                are not only functional but also intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. I’m always eager to explore new
                technologies and apply innovative solutions to my projects.
